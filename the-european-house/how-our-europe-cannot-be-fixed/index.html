      <h1>How Our Europe Cannot Be Fixed</h1>

      <p>
        By this point, the problem is no longer one of diagnosis or imagination.
        We know what is broken, and we know what a functioning Europe would
        require. The three rules—We Choose, We Empower, We Oversee—describe a
        system that could work. Yet Europe remains stuck. This chapter explains
        why. Not because Europeans are unwilling, uninformed, or divided by
        values, but because the current system makes real reform structurally
        impossible. As long as the architecture remains unchanged, every proposed
        solution turns into a detour. To move forward, we must first understand
        why the existing structure actively prevents its own repair.
      </p>

      <h2>Structural Inertia</h2>

      <p>
        Political systems, like buildings, are designed to remain standing. Once
        constructed, they resist fundamental change, especially when that change
        would alter who controls the structure. Europe’s current system was built
        to prevent domination by any single state. In doing so, it also prevented
        the emergence of clear leadership, independent resources, and direct
        accountability.
      </p>

      <p>
        This design flaw is not accidental. Power today is distributed in such a
        way that no actor fully controls outcomes and no actor can be fully blamed
        for failure. National governments retain decisive influence, while
        European institutions carry responsibility without authority. This creates
        a stable but ineffective equilibrium. Everyone is dissatisfied, yet
        everyone benefits from ambiguity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within such a system, there is no internal trigger for transformation.
        Reform would require those who benefit from blurred responsibility to
        voluntarily give it up. Clear leadership would expose failure. Independent
        funding would remove veto power. Transparent oversight would eliminate
        plausible deniability. The system therefore does what all self-preserving
        systems do: it absorbs pressure without changing its core.
      </p>

      <p>
        Incremental adjustments are allowed. New procedures, committees, and
        agreements appear regularly. They create motion, but not direction. They
        relieve tension without altering structure. The result is a system that is
        constantly “reforming” while remaining fundamentally unchanged.
      </p>

      <p>
        In short, Europe cannot fix itself from within because the current rules
        reward survival through inertia.
      </p>

      <h2>Defensive Objections</h2>

      <p>
        Whenever the three rules are proposed, objections appear instantly. They
        sound reasonable. They are repeated often. And they serve a specific
        function: protecting the existing structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some argue that direct elections would be too divisive, too populist, or
        too dangerous. Others claim that independent European funding would be
        unacceptable to citizens or unfair to states. Oversight by citizens chosen
        by lot is dismissed as naïve or unprofessional. These objections differ in
        tone, but they share a common trait: they treat the current system as the
        baseline and any alternative as a risk.
      </p>

      <p>
        What is never questioned is whether the current system already produces
        division, mistrust, and inefficiency. The debate is framed asymmetrically.
        The costs of change are magnified, while the costs of stagnation are
        normalized. Structural failure is presented as inevitable, while
        structural reform is portrayed as reckless.
      </p>

      <p>
        This defensive pattern persists because it protects existing roles.
        Indirect elections protect national gatekeepers. Negotiated funding
        protects veto power. Internal oversight protects professional monopolies.
        Each objection aligns neatly with an existing interest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crucially, these counterarguments do not propose alternative structures.
        They do not explain how leadership, funding, and accountability would
        otherwise be fixed. They function as blockers, not solutions. Their
        purpose is not to improve the system, but to prevent clarity from
        replacing ambiguity.
      </p>

      <p>
        As long as these objections are accepted at face value, the debate remains
        trapped in false dilemmas. The choice is framed as stability versus chaos,
        when in reality the choice is between a system that cannot function and
        one that might.
      </p>

      <h2>Displacement Politics</h2>

      <p>
        Europe is never short of political debate. Migration, inflation, security,
        climate, and technology dominate public discourse. These debates are
        intense, emotional, and seemingly urgent. Yet they rarely lead to
        resolution at the European level.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not because the issues are unsolvable. It is because debating
        outcomes is safer than debating structures.
      </p>

      <p>
        Symptom debates allow politicians to appear active without challenging the
        system that limits their ability to act. One can argue endlessly about
        migration numbers without addressing who has the authority to decide and
        enforce them. One can debate defense spending without confronting the
        absence of unified command. One can promise economic stability without
        explaining how a system without its own budget could deliver it.
      </p>

      <p>
        These debates displace attention. They absorb public energy while leaving
        the foundations untouched. Citizens are encouraged to choose between
        policy positions that cannot be fully implemented under the current rules.
        When results disappoint, frustration is redirected toward institutions,
        individuals, or abstract concepts like “Brussels” or “politics,” rather
        than toward the design itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        This displacement protects the system. It creates the illusion of choice
        while preserving the structure that ensures paralysis. The building’s
        walls are repainted again and again, while the foundations continue to
        crack.
      </p>

      <p>
        As long as political conflict focuses on symptoms, the underlying
        architecture remains invisible—and therefore unchangeable.
      </p>

      <h2>Consensus as Delay</h2>

      <p>
        One of the most powerful arguments against structural reform is the demand
        for consensus. Europe, it is said, is too diverse. Agreement must come
        first. Only then can reform follow.
      </p>

      <p>This logic reverses cause and effect.</p>

      <p>
        The current system produces disagreement because it forces fundamentally
        different interests into constant negotiation without clear rules for
        decision-making. Consensus is not absent because Europeans cannot agree;
        it is absent because the structure rewards vetoes and delay.
      </p>

      <p>
        Waiting for consensus before reform ensures that reform never happens.
        Those who benefit from the status quo always have an incentive to withhold
        agreement. Consensus becomes a tool of preservation, not progress.
      </p>

      <p>
        History shows that structural change rarely begins with unanimity. It
        begins when a clear alternative becomes unavoidable. Democracy did not
        emerge because everyone agreed it was a good idea. It emerged because
        existing systems failed visibly and repeatedly. Agreement followed
        structure, not the other way around.
      </p>

      <p>
        The three rules do not require ideological consensus. They require
        procedural commitment. One can disagree on policy and still agree that
        leaders should be chosen directly, funded transparently, and overseen
        publicly. These are not ideological demands; they are democratic minimums.
      </p>

      <p>
        Treating consensus as a prerequisite for reform turns delay into virtue
        and indecision into responsibility. It ensures that nothing fundamental
        ever changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Europe cannot be fixed under the current system because the system was
        not designed to fix itself. It resists reform through inertia, protects
        itself through defensive arguments, distracts through symptom debates, and
        delays through false appeals to consensus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every path that avoids structural change leads back to the same place.
        More coordination without authority. More promises without resources. More
        transparency without oversight. These are not solutions; they are detours.
      </p>

      <p>
        The three rules expose this reality. They remove false solution paths by
        making one thing clear: outcomes follow structure. As long as the rules
        remain unchanged, the results will remain the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        Europe does not need better intentions. It needs a different design. And
        until that design is demanded consistently and explicitly, the current
        system will continue to do exactly what it was built to do: survive
        without functioning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fixing Europe begins by accepting this limit—and refusing to work around
        it any longer.
