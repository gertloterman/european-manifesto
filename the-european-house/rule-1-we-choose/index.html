      <h1>Rule 1 — We Choose</h1>

      <p>
        In earlier chapters, we walked through the building together. We saw its
        foundations, its walls, and its cracks. We saw how the structure no longer
        works as intended. Decisions that affect everyone are taken far away from
        the people who live inside the building. Responsibility is spread thin.
        Power is blurred. When something goes wrong, nobody can clearly be held to
        account.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before we can repair anything else, we must answer a simple but
        fundamental question: who chooses who is in charge of the building? Rule 1
        addresses exactly that. It is about restoring a direct, visible, and
        shared act of choice at the heart of Europe.
      </p>

      <h2>Situation As-Is</h2>

      <p>
        Imagine a large apartment building with dozens of apartments. The
        inhabitants live their daily lives inside their own homes. They care about
        safety, heating, maintenance, and the long-term value of the building.
        Yet, when it comes to choosing who manages the building itself, they do
        not get a direct say.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, the European building works like this. Citizens vote in national
        elections. Those national governments then negotiate among themselves to
        decide who leads the European institutions. The inhabitants do not choose
        the building manager. The interior contractors choose an exterior
        subcontractor on their behalf.
      </p>

      <p>This creates several structural problems.</p>

      <p>
        First, responsibility is indirect. When the roof leaks or the façade
        crumbles, inhabitants are told to blame “Europe.” But Europe, as they
        experience it, is not something they ever chose directly. The people in
        charge were appointed through backroom negotiations, political trade-offs,
        and national balances. No one was clearly hired by the inhabitants
        themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, power is fragmented. The executive power of the building is spread
        across multiple institutions, each with limited authority and unclear
        leadership. There is no single figure who can say: “I am responsible for
        how this building functions.” Decisions require constant coordination
        between interior contractors, each defending their own apartment’s
        interests.
      </p>

      <p>
        Third, elections feel disconnected. Citizens are asked to vote, but their
        vote does not clearly translate into leadership at the European level.
        They choose interior decorators, not the property manager. Over time, this
        erodes trust. People stop believing that participation changes anything at
        the building level.
      </p>

      <p>
        In short, the building is governed by people who were never directly
        chosen by those who live in it.
      </p>

      <h2>The Rule</h2>

      <p>Rule 1 breaks this pattern at its core.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Europeans directly choose who holds power: one equal vote for a president
          who chooses and leads the executive power, one equal vote for
          representatives who shapes the legislative power, and the candidates
          with the most votes win.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>This rule does not add complexity. It removes it.</p>

      <p>
        In building terms, the inhabitants collectively choose two things.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, they choose the building’s chief executive: a president. This
        person is not the representative of a country, an apartment, or an
        interior contractor. They are hired directly by the inhabitants to run the
        building as a whole. They choose and lead the executive team, just as a
        property manager hires specialists for security, maintenance, energy, and
        long-term planning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, the inhabitants choose representatives who shape the building’s
        rules. These representatives form the legislative power. Their role is
        not to defend individual apartments but to decide, together and in public,
        how the shared spaces are governed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each person gets one equal vote. A vote in a small apartment counts the
        same as a vote in a large one. The building belongs to all who live in it,
        and so does the choice of leadership.
      </p>

      <p>
        And the outcome is clear. The candidates with the most votes win. No
        post-election bargaining. No opaque compromises. No reinterpretation of
        the result behind closed doors.
      </p>

      <p>
        This rule turns elections from a symbolic gesture into a direct act of
        collective ownership.
      </p>

      <h2>Situation To-Be</h2>

      <p>
        Now imagine the same building after Rule 1 is applied.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once every election cycle, the inhabitants know exactly what they are
        voting for. They are not choosing intermediaries who will later negotiate
        power among themselves. They are choosing the people who will actually run
        the building.
      </p>

      <p>
        The president stands before the inhabitants with a clear mandate. Everyone
        knows how they got the job. Everyone knows who chose them. Their authority
        does not come from interior contractors but from the inhabitants directly.
        This changes how they act. They are accountable to the people who live in
        the building, not to the governments of individual apartments.
      </p>

      <p>
        The executive power becomes coherent. The president chooses a team that
        can actually act, plan, and execute. When a decision is made, it is clear
        who made it. When something fails, it is clear who must answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time, the legislative representatives debate and decide the
        rules of the building in the open. Their legitimacy is equally direct.
        They do not owe their seat to national party deals but to the inhabitants
        themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        This changes the political culture of the building. Campaigns are no
        longer about national pride or fear of losing control. They are about
        shared problems and shared solutions. Heating, security, energy
        independence, infrastructure, digital systems, external threats—these are
        building-wide issues, and they are debated as such.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most importantly, the inhabitants begin to recognize themselves in the
        building again. They may disagree with decisions, but they can no longer
        say: “I did not choose this.” The line between choice, power, and
        responsibility becomes visible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rule 1 does not magically fix all problems. But it fixes the entrance
        door. It establishes who hands over the keys. Without that, no renovation
        can ever truly succeed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rule 1 is not about ideology. It is about structure. A shared building
        cannot function if its inhabitants do not directly choose who runs it. As
        long as power flows indirectly, accountability dissolves and trust erodes.
      </p>

      <p>
        By choosing directly, Europeans stop being passive tenants in a building
        managed by others. They become collective owners who hire their leadership
        openly and transparently.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the first repair. It does not yet strengthen the walls or
        modernize the systems. But it ensures that the people holding the tools
        were chosen by those who live inside. Only then does it make sense to talk
        about empowerment, resources, and oversight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before we fix how Europe acts, we must first fix how Europe chooses.
