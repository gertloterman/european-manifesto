      <h1>Rule 2 — We Empower</h1>

      <p>
        Power without resources is an illusion. In the previous chapter, Europe’s
        inhabitants finally chose who would lead the shared building. The
        president was elected. Representatives were chosen. For the first time,
        the building had a clear chain of command that flowed directly from its
        inhabitants. But as anyone who has ever managed a building knows, choosing
        a property contractor is only half the work. If that contractor has no
        independent budget, no keys to the bank account, and no authority to pay
        for repairs, the cracks will remain. This chapter explains why Europe, as
        it exists today, cannot function without its own resources, and how Rule 2
        gives real substance to the choice made under Rule 1.
      </p>

      <h2>Situation As-Is</h2>

      <p>
        Today, the shared European building looks impressive from the outside,
        but its financial wiring runs through every apartment. The exterior
        subcontractor – the EU government as it exists now – does not have its own
        wallet. Instead, it must ask the interior contractors, the national
        governments, for money every time something needs to be done.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine a leaking roof. Rainwater seeps into several apartments. The
        inhabitants complain. The exterior subcontractor agrees that repairs are
        necessary, but cannot act. It must first ask each interior contractor how
        much they are willing to contribute. Some agree quickly. Others hesitate,
        arguing that the leak is worse above other apartments. A few threaten to
        block the repair entirely unless they receive something in return for
        their own apartment. While negotiations drag on, the leak grows. The
        damage spreads.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not a hypothetical situation. It is the daily reality of European
        decision-making. The EU budget is largely funded by contributions from
        member states. These contributions are negotiated, conditional, and
        politically sensitive. As a result, European institutions are structurally
        dependent on national governments for their most basic functioning.
      </p>

      <p>
        This dependency has three consequences. First, it slows everything down.
        Decisions are shaped not by urgency or common interest, but by bargaining
        power. Second, it distorts priorities. Funds are allocated based on what
        national governments are willing to pay for, not on what the shared
        building actually needs. Third, it undermines responsibility. When
        something goes wrong, interior contractors blame the exterior
        subcontractor for incompetence, while quietly reminding everyone that they
        never gave it sufficient resources in the first place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most importantly, the inhabitants are entirely disconnected from this
        financial process. Citizens may vote in European elections, but they do
        not directly fund the institution they vote for. Their financial
        contribution remains filtered through national systems, bundled into
        national budgets, and repackaged as national generosity or national
        sacrifice. The result is predictable: Europe is accused of being
        expensive, even though no one can clearly say what they personally pay for
        it or what they receive in return.
      </p>

      <p>
        A building funded this way cannot be well maintained. It survives, but it
        never thrives.
      </p>

      <h2>The Rule</h2>

      <p>
        Rule 2 addresses this structural weakness directly. It does not add
        complexity. It removes a layer.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Europeans directly fund the power they choose: one shared contribution
          finances European power, without an extra layer of taxation, giving it
          the independence it needs to function.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        This rule is simple, but its implications are profound. It means that
        once Europeans have chosen their leaders under Rule 1, they also give
        those leaders the means to act. Not by inventing new taxes, not by piling
        another bill on top of national systems, but by redirecting part of what
        already exists into a shared European contribution.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the building metaphor, this is the moment when the inhabitants
        collectively agree to pay a monthly fee directly to the property
        contractor. The fee is visible. Everyone knows how much it is. Everyone
        knows what it is for. The contractor no longer has to beg individual
        interior contractors every time the elevator breaks.
      </p>

      <p>
        This shared contribution creates a direct financial relationship between
        the inhabitants and the European institutions. Power and money are
        aligned. Choice and responsibility are linked. If the inhabitants are
        unhappy with how the building is managed, they know exactly whom to blame
        and what they are paying for.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crucially, this rule does not increase the overall burden on citizens. It
        replaces fragmented national contributions with a transparent, shared one.
        The total cost may remain similar, but the structure changes entirely.
        The European level gains independence. National governments lose the
        ability to quietly starve European institutions while publicly blaming
        them for poor results.
      </p>

      <h2>Situation To-Be</h2>

      <p>
        Once Rule 2 is implemented, the shared building begins to function like a
        real collective project. The property contractor has a stable budget.
        Maintenance is planned, not improvised. Investments are made with a
        long-term view, because funding is no longer hostage to short-term
        national politics.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a problem arises, the response changes fundamentally. The property
        contractor no longer asks all interior contractors for permission. It acts
        within a budget that has already been democratically approved by the
        inhabitants. Accountability becomes clear. If money is wasted, it is
        visible. If results are delivered, they are measurable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The psychological shift is just as important as the financial one.
        Inhabitants no longer experience Europe as an abstract cost hidden in
        national accounts. They experience it as a shared service they consciously
        fund. The question changes from “Why does Europe cost so much?” to “Is
        Europe delivering value for what we collectively invest?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Interior contractors also benefit, even if they resist at first. Freed
        from constant budgetary negotiations at European level, they can focus on
        their core task: managing their own apartments. They can no longer use
        Europe as a convenient scapegoat for domestic failures, nor can they
        quietly claim credit for European successes they did not fund.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most importantly, the combination of Rule 1 and Rule 2 completes a
        democratic circuit. Citizens choose European power. Citizens fund European
        power. Power becomes real, but also limited and exposed. There is no
        longer an excuse for paralysis, and no hiding place for incompetence.
      </p>

      <p>
        A building with a chosen contractor and a guaranteed maintenance budget
        can finally be more than a collection of patched repairs. It can be
        improved. It can be prepared for future challenges. It can be trusted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rule 2 is where Europe stops pretending and starts functioning. Choice
        without funding is theatre. Funding without choice is coercion. By
        directly empowering the institutions they choose, Europeans turn their
        shared building into a common project rather than a permanent negotiation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This rule does not demand more Europe. It demands clearer Europe. A Europe
        that knows what it is responsible for, what it costs, and what it must
        deliver. In the next chapter, we will see how this empowered system is
        kept in check, ensuring that the power and resources Europeans grant are
        never allowed to drift away from the inhabitants themselves.
