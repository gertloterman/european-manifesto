      <h1>Rule 3 — We Oversee</h1>

      <p>
        By now, the reader understands the problem and the first two answers to it.
        The European building exists, but it was designed without its inhabitants
        in mind. Power drifted upward without consent, money flowed without
        clarity, and responsibility became diluted across too many levels. Rule 1
        gave the inhabitants a voice. Rule 2 gave that voice the resources to
        matter. Yet even a chosen and funded authority can fail if it is left
        alone too long. Every building, no matter how well designed, needs
        oversight. That is where Rule 3 begins.
      </p>

      <p>
        This chapter explains why oversight is the missing structural element in
        today’s Europe, how it is currently broken, and what changes when
        Europeans reclaim that function themselves.
      </p>

      <h2>Situation As-Is</h2>

      <p>
        Imagine a large shared apartment building. The inhabitants pay for
        maintenance. They have contractors. They even have a management structure.
        But they are not allowed to see the plans, the invoices, or the decisions
        that affect the building’s structure. They are told: trust us.
      </p>

      <p>This is the situation in Europe today.</p>

      <p>
        The current European system has oversight mechanisms on paper: committees,
        audits, courts, reporting obligations. But these mechanisms operate largely
        inside the same professional and political ecosystem. Oversight is
        performed by people who were appointed by those they oversee, or who
        circulate through the same institutions over time. It is oversight among
        contractors, not oversight by inhabitants.
      </p>

      <p>
        Citizens are formally sovereign, but practically distant. They receive
        summaries instead of raw information. They are consulted after decisions
        are made. Transparency exists in theory but not in lived experience.
        Documents are technically public, but buried in complexity, released too
        late, or framed in a way that only specialists can interpret.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the building metaphor, this is like allowing residents to inspect the
        basement only after the walls are already cracked, and only if they bring
        their own engineer.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result, mistrust grows. Not necessarily because corruption is
        everywhere, but because opacity always breeds suspicion. When people do
        not see how decisions are made or how money flows, they fill the gap with
        assumptions. Some imagine incompetence. Others imagine conspiracy. Both
        reactions weaken the shared structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        The deeper problem is structural. Oversight is treated as an internal
        function of power, rather than as a right and duty of those who live with
        its consequences. The inhabitants are expected to vote, pay, and then step
        aside.
      </p>

      <p>No building survives that way.</p>

      <h2>The Rule</h2>

      <p>Rule 3 is the missing piece.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Europeans directly oversee the power they choose and fund: citizens
          chosen by lot watch the system, all shared decisions are publicly
          documented, and every income and spending is fully transparent.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        This rule completes the triangle formed by choosing and empowering. It
        transforms citizens from occasional voters into permanent guardians of the
        shared structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oversight here does not mean daily micromanagement. Just as inhabitants do
        not tell electricians how to wire cables, citizens do not run ministries.
        Oversight means visibility, accountability, and the constant possibility
        of correction.
      </p>

      <p>The rule rests on three pillars.</p>

      <p>
        First, citizens chosen by lot. Random selection breaks the professional
        monopoly on oversight. It ensures that supervision does not belong to a
        political class, a media elite, or a permanent watchdog industry. Ordinary
        inhabitants, temporarily entrusted with responsibility, bring fresh eyes
        and common sense. They are harder to capture, harder to intimidate, and
        harder to predict.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, all shared decisions are public. Not just the outcomes, but the
        reasoning, the alternatives considered, and the trade-offs accepted. This
        does not mean chaos or permanent debate. It means that once a decision
        concerns the shared building, it belongs to the shared space. Nothing
        structural happens behind closed doors.
      </p>

      <p>
        Third, every income and expense is transparent. Money is the nervous
        system of power. When it is opaque, the system becomes numb and
        unresponsive. When it is visible, waste and abuse are harder to hide, and
        priorities become explicit. Transparency here is not symbolic; it is
        operational, real-time, and understandable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, these elements turn oversight into a living function, embedded
        in the daily life of the building.
      </p>

      <h2>Situation To-Be</h2>

      <p>
        Now imagine the same European building redesigned with this rule in place.
      </p>

      <p>
        The inhabitants still live in different apartments. National governments
        still manage their interiors. But the shared structure is no longer a
        black box.
      </p>

      <p>
        At regular intervals, groups of citizens are selected by lot to serve as
        overseers. They receive training, access, and legal protection. Their task
        is not to govern, but to observe, question, and report. They sit in on
        processes, examine budgets, follow decision paths, and speak publicly
        about what they see.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because they are temporary and diverse, no single ideology dominates.
        Because they are citizens, not professionals, they ask the kinds of
        questions that experts sometimes forget to ask: why this priority, why
        this cost, why now.
      </p>

      <p>
        All major European decisions become traceable. A resident can follow how a
        regulation was proposed, debated, amended, and adopted. Not through
        slogans, but through a clear narrative of responsibility. Disagreement
        does not disappear, but confusion does.
      </p>

      <p>
        Financial flows are displayed like building maintenance accounts. Everyone
        can see what comes in, where it goes, and why. This does not turn every
        citizen into an accountant, but it creates a shared reference point.
        Arguments become grounded in facts rather than suspicions.
      </p>

      <p>Crucially, this oversight does not weaken authority. It strengthens it.</p>

      <p>
        A property contractor who knows that inhabitants are watching builds
        better. They plan more carefully, explain more clearly, and correct
        faster. Trust stops being a demand and becomes a consequence.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this system, scandals do not explode suddenly after years of silence.
        Problems surface early, while they are still repairable. Errors are
        acknowledged as part of governance, not as proof of betrayal.
      </p>

      <p>
        The emotional shift is profound. Inhabitants no longer feel ruled from
        above, but responsible from within. Europe stops feeling like a distant
        administration and starts feeling like a shared home that requires care.
      </p>

      <p>Rule 3 is not about suspicion. It is about maturity.</p>

      <p>
        A shared building cannot rely forever on blind trust. Nor can it survive
        permanent cynicism. Oversight is the bridge between confidence and
        control, between delegation and responsibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        By choosing power, Europeans reclaim authority. By funding it, they give
        it strength. By overseeing it, they give it legitimacy.
      </p>

      <p>
        This rule closes the loop. It ensures that Europe is not only governed in
        the name of its inhabitants, but visibly, continuously, and accountably
        for them. In doing so, it turns democracy from a periodic event into a
        living structure, as solid and transparent as the building it is meant to
        sustain.
