      <h1>When Our Europe Works</h1>

      <p>
        Europeans have been told for decades what Europe is not able to do. Too
        slow. Too divided. Too weak. Too distant. Those judgments were not
        wrong—but they were never inevitable. They were the result of a system
        designed to dilute responsibility, fragment power, and obscure
        accountability.
      </p>

      <p>
        This chapter asks a different question. Not what Europe lacks, but what
        happens when Europe works. When the three rules—We Choose, We Empower,
        and We Oversee—operate together, the European system changes its nature.
        It stops being a fragile compromise between governments and becomes a
        functioning political community. The transformation is not abstract. It
        produces concrete outcomes: strong leadership, real resources, and
        genuine accountability.
      </p>

      <h2>Strong Leadership</h2>

      <p>When power is chosen directly, leadership becomes real.</p>

      <p>
        In today’s Europe, leadership is negotiated behind closed doors.
        Executives are assembled through complex bargains between governments,
        parties, and institutions. Responsibility is shared so widely that it
        disappears. When things go wrong, no one truly owns the decision.
      </p>

      <p>Under Rule 1—We Choose—that logic breaks.</p>

      <p>
        Europeans directly elect a president. One person. One mandate. One clear
        source of authority. That president does not emerge from diplomatic
        compromise but from the same democratic act that elects leaders at
        national level: a majority of citizens choosing a direction.
      </p>

      <p>This changes everything.</p>

      <p>
        First, it gives Europe a face. Not a symbol, not a spokesperson, but a
        leader with political weight. Someone who can speak for Europe because
        Europe explicitly chose them. On the world stage, this ends the ambiguity
        that weakens Europe today. Allies and rivals no longer ask who speaks for
        Europe. The answer is clear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, it restores responsibility. The president chooses and leads the
        executive. Successes and failures can no longer be blurred across
        institutions. Leadership becomes visible, measurable, and therefore
        accountable. Citizens know who to credit—and who to replace.
      </p>

      <p>
        Third, it enables decisiveness. A directly chosen executive does not need
        to constantly balance national vetoes or institutional rivalries. It can
        act within a clear mandate set by voters and constrained by law. This
        does not weaken democracy. It strengthens it by aligning authority with
        consent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Strong leadership does not mean unchecked power. It means power that is
        clearly located, openly exercised, and democratically grounded. Europe
        does not become authoritarian when it chooses leaders. It becomes
        governable.
      </p>

      <h2>Own Resources</h2>

      <p>When power is funded directly, it becomes independent.</p>

      <p>
        Today, Europe depends on its member states for money. Every budget is the
        result of negotiation, threat, and delay. Funding becomes a tool of
        control. Institutions that should act in the European interest are forced
        to bargain for survival.
      </p>

      <p>Rule 2—We Empower—cuts through this dependency.</p>

      <p>
        Europeans directly fund the institutions they choose. One shared
        contribution. No additional layer of taxation. No hidden transfers. Just
        a transparent, collective investment in the system that represents them.
      </p>

      <p>This changes the relationship between Europe and its citizens.</p>

      <p>
        First, it gives Europe autonomy. An institution that depends on annual
        bargaining cannot plan long-term, act strategically, or respond quickly to
        crises. An institution with its own resources can. Independence is not
        about power for its own sake. It is about the ability to do the job
        citizens expect.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, it creates clarity. Citizens know exactly what they contribute
        and what it funds. There is no illusion that Europe is “free” or that
        someone else is paying. Ownership replaces resentment. Investment replaces
        suspicion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Third, it enables scale. Economic power, defense capacity, infrastructure,
        research, and crisis response all require sustained funding. Fragmented
        national contributions cannot deliver European-level outcomes. Shared
        resources can.
      </p>

      <p>
        Importantly, this does not mean Europe becomes wasteful or distant. On
        the contrary. When citizens fund institutions directly, scrutiny
        increases. Every euro must be justified. Waste becomes politically
        dangerous. Efficiency becomes a democratic demand.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Europe with its own resources is not a Europe that takes more. It is a
        Europe that can finally act with coherence and credibility.
      </p>

      <h2>Real Accountability</h2>

      <p>When power is overseen directly, trust becomes possible.</p>

      <p>
        Europe’s greatest deficit is not democratic legitimacy on paper. It is
        the feeling that no one is watching. Decisions seem remote. Processes
        feel opaque. Even when rules exist, citizens do not experience control.
      </p>

      <p>Rule 3—We Oversee—addresses this gap directly.</p>

      <p>
        Oversight is not symbolic. Citizens chosen by lot are given the task of
        watching the institutions. They are not politicians. They are not
        lobbyists. They are Europeans, temporarily entrusted with a public role.
      </p>

      <p>This has profound consequences.</p>

      <p>
        First, it breaks the monopoly of insiders. Oversight is no longer
        confined to committees speaking a language few understand. It becomes
        grounded in ordinary perspectives asking simple but powerful questions:
        Why this decision? Why this cost? Who benefits?
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, it forces transparency to become real. All shared decisions are
        public. Every income and expense is visible. Secrecy stops being the
        default. Explanation becomes mandatory.
      </p>

      <p>
        Third, it restores trust without naivety. Oversight does not assume
        institutions are corrupt, but it does not assume they are virtuous
        either. It accepts a basic democratic truth: power behaves better when
        watched.
      </p>

      <p>
        Crucially, oversight completes the system. Choosing power without
        oversight creates risk. Funding power without oversight creates
        resentment. Oversight ensures that choice and empowerment remain aligned
        with the public interest.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not a system built on blind faith. It is a system built on
        continuous visibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        Europe’s failure has never been cultural, historical, or emotional. It
        has been structural. When the structure changes, behavior follows.
      </p>

      <p>
        This chapter is not a vision of perfection. It is a vision of
        functionality. Of a Europe that can lead, act, and be trusted because the
        rules align power with people.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Europeans choose together, fund together, and oversee together,
        Europe stops being an experiment and becomes a system. Not a replacement
        for nations, but a shared instrument capable of doing what nations alone
        no longer can.
      </p>

      <p>This is what Europe looks like when it works.</p>
