      <h1>Why Our Europe Feels Broken</h1>

      <p>
        Europe did not fall apart overnight. It did not collapse in a single crisis,
        nor was it destroyed by a single bad decision. Instead, something quieter
        happened. Day after day, small problems were patched. Temporary solutions
        became permanent habits. Responsibilities blurred. Trust slowly thinned.
      </p>

      <p>
        To understand why Europe feels broken today, we need to step inside the system
        as it is lived—not as it is described in treaties or speeches. We need to
        walk through the shared building we all live in and observe how it is
        managed. What we find is not chaos, but something more frustrating: a
        building where no one is clearly in charge, where there is no shared budget
        for shared problems, and where blame travels faster than responsibility.
      </p>

      <h2>No One Is in Charge</h2>

      <p>
        Imagine a large apartment building shared by dozens of families. The
        hallways are cracked. The roof leaks. The heating system is outdated.
        Everyone agrees the building needs care.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now imagine that no one actually manages the building.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each apartment has its own interior contractor. These contractors are hired
        by the families living inside. They decide how the kitchens look, how the
        walls are painted, how the rooms are arranged. They are accountable to the
        people inside their apartment—and nowhere else.
      </p>

      <p>
        When something breaks inside an apartment, this works well. The contractor
        is called. The problem is fixed. Responsibility is clear.
      </p>

      <p>
        But when something breaks outside—when the roof leaks, when the elevator
        fails, when the facade crumbles—the situation changes. The building has an
        exterior subcontractor. This subcontractor does not work directly for the
        inhabitants. Instead, they take instructions from the interior contractors.
        One contractor wants the roof fixed quickly. Another wants to wait. A third
        wants to spend less. A fourth disagrees with the materials.
      </p>

      <p>
        The exterior subcontractor listens to all of them. Then waits.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is how Europe currently works. The European level is asked to act, but
        it is not allowed to lead. It receives tasks, but not authority. It is
        expected to solve shared problems without being clearly in charge of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        When a crisis hits—financial instability, migration pressure, a pandemic, a
        war at the borders—citizens look up and ask: who decides? The answer is
        never simple. Sometimes it is a council. Sometimes a commission. Sometimes
        national leaders negotiating behind closed doors. Often, it is all of them
        at once.
      </p>

      <p>
        Leadership dissolves into coordination. Decision-making turns into
        negotiation. Action becomes delay.
      </p>

      <p>
        And when the outcome disappoints, everyone feels it—but no one feels
        responsible.
      </p>

      <h2>There Is No Own Budget</h2>

      <p>
        Now imagine that the building does not have its own bank account.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every time the roof needs repair, the exterior subcontractor must ask the
        apartment contractors to contribute. Some apartments are larger. Some are
        smaller. Some say they already paid too much last time. Others say the
        damage is not above their side of the building.
      </p>

      <p>
        Weeks pass. Emails circulate. Meetings are held. The leak continues.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is Europe’s financial reality. The shared building has no real
        financial autonomy. It cannot plan long-term maintenance. It cannot invest
        decisively in prevention. It cannot respond quickly when emergencies arise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead, it depends on contributions negotiated between apartments. These
        contributions are often framed as costs rather than investments. Money
        becomes a symbol of loss rather than shared gain.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result, Europe is expected to deliver stability, growth, protection,
        and security—without the financial tools normally required to do so. It is
        asked to act like a property manager while being funded like a volunteer
        committee.
      </p>

      <p>
        Citizens feel the contradiction. They see big expectations paired with
        small means. They hear promises followed by hesitation. The building looks
        impressive from afar, but inside, the infrastructure strains.
      </p>

      <p>
        And when repairs finally happen, they often arrive late, underfunded, or
        compromised by political trade-offs that no inhabitant ever voted for
        directly.
      </p>

      <h2>Everyone Is to Blame</h2>

      <p>
        When something goes wrong in this building, the blame starts moving.
      </p>

      <p>
        The inhabitants blame their interior contractors for not defending their
        interests strongly enough. The interior contractors blame the exterior
        subcontractor for inefficiency. The exterior subcontractor points back to
        conflicting instructions from the contractors.
      </p>

      <p>
        No one is lying. Everyone is partially right. And that is precisely the
        problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        Responsibility is so fragmented that accountability evaporates.
      </p>

      <p>
        Citizens feel this deeply. They sense that decisions affect their lives,
        but they cannot clearly trace those decisions back to a person or
        institution they chose. Elections happen, but the outcomes feel distant.
        Power exists, but it is hard to locate.
      </p>

      <p>
        This creates a dangerous emotional loop. When things improve, no one knows
        whom to thank. When things worsen, frustration has nowhere to land—except
        on “Europe” as an abstract idea.
      </p>

      <p>
        The building itself becomes the villain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, this erodes trust. People stop believing that shared solutions
        are possible. National debates grow louder, sharper, and more defensive.
        Each apartment begins to focus inward, renovating its own rooms while
        ignoring the cracks spreading through the structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tragedy is that the building still stands. It still protects its
        inhabitants. But it no longer inspires confidence. It feels brittle.
        Temporary. Mismanaged.
      </p>

      <p>
        Europe does not feel broken because its foundations are weak. Its history,
        values, and cooperation remain strong. It feels broken because the way it
        is run does not match the scale of the building it has become.
      </p>

      <p>
        A shared building without clear leadership, without its own budget, and
        without real accountability will always struggle—no matter how noble its
        intentions. The discomfort citizens feel today is not confusion. It is
        recognition.
      </p>

      <p>
        They sense that the problem is structural, not cultural. That the issue is
        design, not destiny.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understanding this is the first step—not toward blame, but toward repair.
