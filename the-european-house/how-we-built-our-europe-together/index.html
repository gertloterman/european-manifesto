      <h1>How We Built Our Europe Together</h1>

      <p>
        Europe did not come together because it was easy. It came together because
        what came before had become unbearable.
      </p>

      <p>
        This chapter is about movement rather than ideals. About what happened
        when old certainties collapsed, when borders hardened, when nations turned
        inward—and what followed when people slowly understood that survival
        itself required a different path. Democracy, rule of law, and liberty were
        answers to instability. European cooperation was the next answer, born not
        from optimism, but from exhaustion.
      </p>

      <h2>War</h2>

      <p>
        At the beginning of the twentieth century, Europe was powerful, confident,
        and deeply divided. Empires ruled vast territories. Nations competed for
        land, resources, and prestige. Industrial progress accelerated
        everything—production, transport, communication—but also magnified
        rivalry. Old diplomatic balances could no longer absorb new pressures.
      </p>

      <p>
        The First World War shattered the illusion that conflict could be
        contained. It destroyed empires, redrew borders, and left millions dead.
        Yet the war did not resolve Europe’s underlying tensions. Instead, it
        created resentment, humiliation, and economic fragility. New states
        emerged without strong institutions. Old grievances hardened rather than
        healed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The years that followed were unstable and angry. Economic crisis spread.
        Democracy, where it existed, was fragile. Extremist movements promised
        order, pride, and certainty. Many Europeans did not choose dictatorship
        because they rejected freedom, but because chaos had made freedom feel
        unsafe.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Second World War was the consequence of this failure. It was not an
        accident, nor a sudden madness. It was the result of unresolved division,
        weaponized fear, and the belief that power could still be secured through
        domination. The scale of destruction was unprecedented. Cities were
        reduced to rubble. Entire populations were displaced or exterminated.
        Moral boundaries collapsed alongside physical ones.
      </p>

      <p>
        By 1945, Europe was broken—not only materially, but psychologically. The
        continent had proven to itself that rivalry between nations, when left
        unchecked, led not to glory, but to ruin. The question was no longer how
        to win, but how to prevent this from ever happening again.
      </p>

      <h2>Peace</h2>

      <p>
        After the war, Europe faced a stark choice. It could attempt to rebuild
        the old system—independent nations guarding their sovereignty, balancing
        power through alliances and deterrence. Or it could try something
        radically different.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first steps toward cooperation were cautious and practical. They
        focused not on lofty ideals, but on concrete risks. Coal and steel, the
        raw materials of war, became the starting point. If former enemies shared
        control over the industries that made weapons possible, war between them
        would become not only unthinkable, but materially impossible.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was a quiet revolution. No flags were lowered. No nations
        disappeared. But something fundamental changed: states began to bind
        themselves together voluntarily, limiting their own freedom of action in
        exchange for mutual security.
      </p>

      <p>
        Economic cooperation followed. Trade barriers were reduced. Common rules
        were introduced. Markets slowly intertwined. Prosperity returned,
        unevenly at first, but convincingly enough to change political instincts.
        Cooperation stopped being seen as a concession and started being
        experienced as a benefit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as important was the psychological shift. Former enemies met
        regularly, negotiated constantly, and solved disputes through
        institutions rather than threats. Habits changed. Trust did not appear
        overnight, but it accumulated through repetition. Each crisis managed
        without violence strengthened the belief that this new path worked.
      </p>

      <p>
        Peace, in this sense, was not an abstract condition. It was something
        built daily through procedures, compromises, and shared interests. It was
        maintained not by the absence of conflict, but by the presence of
        mechanisms to deal with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the first time in centuries, large parts of Europe experienced peace
        not as a pause between wars, but as a stable condition. A generation grew
        up without mobilization orders, without enemy propaganda, without borders
        defined by trenches.
      </p>

      <h2>The European Union</h2>

      <p>
        Out of this long process of cooperation, the European Union emerged—not
        as a grand design imposed from above, but as an accumulation of decisions
        made over decades. Each step responded to a specific problem: economic
        recovery, political stability, internal market efficiency, global
        competitiveness.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Union was never meant to replace nations. It was meant to connect
        them so tightly that old patterns of conflict would lose their force.
        Shared rules replaced power struggles. Courts replaced retaliation.
        Negotiation replaced coercion.
      </p>

      <p>
        This system worked remarkably well at what it was designed to do. War
        between member states became unimaginable. Economies integrated deeply.
        Citizens gained the ability to move, work, and live across borders.
        Smaller countries gained influence they could never have achieved alone.
        Europe became a global economic power without becoming a military empire.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet this success also created new complexities. The Union grew larger and
        more diverse. Decisions became harder. Responsibility became diffused.
        The system, designed to prevent domination by any single state, also
        made leadership difficult. Power was shared, but accountability was
        blurred.
      </p>

      <p>
        Still, it is important to remember what the Union represents historically.
        It is the most ambitious attempt ever made to organize peaceful coexistence
        between sovereign states without force. It is a structure built not on
        conquest, but on consent. Not on uniformity, but on managed difference.
      </p>

      <p>
        Europe did not stumble into this arrangement. It chose it, again and
        again, each time preferring shared solutions over national isolation. The
        choice was never perfect. But it was deliberate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Europe came together because it had learned, through catastrophe, what
        division costs. The Union is not the expression of naïve idealism. It is
        the institutional memory of failure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every treaty, every shared rule, every compromise carries the weight of
        history. They exist because earlier systems collapsed under pressure.
        Cooperation was not chosen because Europeans suddenly trusted each other.
        It was chosen because distrust had proven lethal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Understanding how Europe was built matters, because it explains why it
        looks the way it does today. Its caution, its complexity, its obsession
        with process—all are responses to a past where unchecked power led to
        disaster.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Europe we inherited is not finished, and it is not flawless. But it
        was built with intention, out of ruins, by people who knew exactly what
        was at stake. Before asking what Europe should become, we must first
        recognize what it was built to prevent—and why that achievement still
        matters.
