      <h1>What Our Europe Can Do</h1>

      <p>
        Up to this point, we have faced an uncomfortable truth: Europe, as it is
        today, cannot act with the strength its size and values deserve. Not
        because Europeans lack talent, resources, or ambition—but because power is
        fragmented, funding is indirect, and oversight is weak.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now imagine something different. Imagine a Europe where the rules are
        clear and unbreakable. Where power is chosen directly, funded directly,
        and watched directly by the people.
      </p>

      <p>
        This chapter is not about ideals. It is about consequences. What becomes
        possible—concretely, visibly, and immediately—when the three rules are
        guaranteed. What follows is not a dream of a distant future, but a
        description of a system finally allowed to use its full weight.
      </p>

      <h2>Economic Power</h2>

      <p>
        Europe is already one of the largest economic areas on Earth. But today,
        its strength is scattered. National budgets pull in different directions.
        Shared projects move slowly. Crises are answered late and unevenly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Under the three rules, Europe becomes something else: a single economic
        actor with democratic legitimacy and financial autonomy.
      </p>

      <p>
        With Rule 1, economic leadership is no longer negotiated behind closed
        doors between governments. A European executive is chosen directly by
        citizens, with a clear mandate to act. This leadership does not represent
        states—it represents people. That difference is decisive. It means
        economic policy is designed for Europe as a whole, not diluted to satisfy
        vetoes.
      </p>

      <p>
        With Rule 2, Europe controls its own resources. A shared contribution,
        transparently defined and democratically approved, replaces dependence on
        national goodwill. This is not an extra tax layer. It is a reallocation
        of responsibility. Europe can plan long-term investments without begging,
        delaying, or compromising its goals.
      </p>

      <p>What does this make possible?</p>

      <p>
        Europe can invest at scale in infrastructure that no single country can
        build alone: continental energy grids, shared high-speed transport, and
        digital public infrastructure owned by the public. Europe can stabilize
        its economy in crises—not by improvisation, but through automatic
        mechanisms decided in advance. When shocks come, help is fast, fair, and
        predictable.
      </p>

      <p>
        It also means Europe can protect its internal market. Social dumping, tax
        avoidance, and regulatory arbitrage lose their power when enforcement is
        unified. Companies compete on innovation and quality, not on exploiting
        gaps between systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Economic power, in this Europe, is not about domination. It is about
        reliability. Citizens know the system can act. Businesses know the rules
        are stable. Investors know decisions are made democratically and
        transparently. Trust becomes an economic force.
      </p>

      <h2>Defense Power</h2>

      <p>
        For decades, Europe has spoken softly about defense while relying heavily
        on others for protection. This dependency has shaped foreign policy,
        limited strategic choices, and exposed vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the three rules in place, Europe gains something it has never truly
        had: the ability to decide and defend its own security.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rule 1 gives defense policy democratic legitimacy. Decisions about
        military engagement, deterrence, and defense priorities are no longer the
        result of fragile intergovernmental compromises. They are guided by
        leaders chosen directly to take responsibility for Europe’s security.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rule 2 ensures that defense is properly funded—not excessively, but
        seriously. Fragmented national defense budgets are inefficient. Shared
        funding allows Europe to pool resources, reduce duplication, and invest
        in capabilities that matter: intelligence, cybersecurity, strategic
        mobility, and defensive technology.
      </p>

      <p>This does not mean Europe becomes aggressive. It means Europe becomes credible.</p>

      <p>
        A credible Europe can protect its borders without panic. It can respond
        to threats without escalation. It can support allies without hesitation.
        Most importantly, it can prevent conflict by being taken seriously.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rule 3 ensures that defense power does not drift into secrecy and abuse.
        Oversight by citizens chosen by lot, combined with strict transparency
        rules, keeps power under control. Decisions to use force are visible,
        justified, and accountable. This is defense without militarism.
      </p>

      <p>
        In practice, this Europe can coordinate border protection humanely and
        effectively. It can defend critical infrastructure against cyberattacks.
        It can contribute meaningfully to peacekeeping and crisis prevention. It
        no longer reacts—it prepares.
      </p>

      <h2>Political Power</h2>

      <p>Perhaps the greatest transformation happens here.</p>

      <p>
        Today, Europe is politically present but not politically powerful. It
        negotiates endlessly, speaks cautiously, and often arrives late. Its
        voice is divided because its authority is unclear.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the three rules are guaranteed, Europe gains political weight simply
        by being coherent.
      </p>

      <p>
        With Rule 1, leadership is unmistakable. There is no confusion about who
        speaks for Europe. No rotating chairs. No diluted mandates. When Europe
        speaks, the world knows the speaker has the backing of half a billion of
        citizens.
      </p>

      <p>
        With Rule 2, promises are credible. Agreements on climate, trade, or
        humanitarian aid are backed by guaranteed funding. Europe no longer signs
        declarations it cannot fully implement.
      </p>

      <p>
        With Rule 3, legitimacy is visible. Decisions are not only democratic—they
        are seen to be democratic. Transparency is not a slogan; it is a
        structural fact. This changes how citizens relate to power and how
        external partners perceive it.
      </p>

      <p>What does this mean in practice?</p>

      <p>
        Europe can lead on climate policy without hypocrisy, aligning internal
        action with external demands. It can negotiate trade agreements that
        defend labor standards and environmental rules because it can enforce
        them. It can mediate conflicts because it is not seen as weak or divided.
      </p>

      <p>
        Political power here is not about imposing values. It is about embodying
        them so clearly that they carry weight on their own.
      </p>

      <p>
        This chapter is not about making Europe bigger. It is about making Europe
        functional.
      </p>

      <p>
        When power is chosen directly, funded directly, and overseen directly,
        Europe stops being a collection of intentions and becomes a system that
        acts. Economic strength becomes usable. Defense becomes credible. Politics
        becomes meaningful.
      </p>

      <p>
        What our Europe can do is not abstract. It can protect, invest, stabilize,
        and lead—because it finally has the structure to do so.
      </p>

      <p>
        The question is no longer whether Europe has the capacity. It always did.
        The real question is whether we are ready to allow that capacity to
        exist.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not the end of the story. It is the moment where the story
        becomes real.
