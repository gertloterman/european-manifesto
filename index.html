        <strong>The Three Necessary Rules for a Europe That Can Act</strong>

      <h2>Preamble</h2>

      <p>
        Europe is its people — bound by rights, freedom, and democracy.<br />
        Yet Europe is trapped in a system that cannot act.
      </p>

      <p>
        When action is needed, no one is in charge.<br />
        When something goes wrong, everyone is to blame.<br />
        And when the bill arrives, Europeans pay.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Europe that works needs a few basic rules.<br />
        Without them, no policy — however well-intentioned — can succeed.
      </p>

      <h2>Rule 1 — We Choose</h2>

      <p>Europeans directly choose who holds European power.</p>

      <p>
        Each European has one equal vote for a president who chooses and leads the executive.<br />
        Each European has one equal vote for representatives who shape European law.<br />
        Those who receive the most votes take office.
      </p>

      <h2>Rule 2 — We Empower</h2>

      <p>Europeans directly fund the power they choose.</p>

      <p>
        A shared European contribution finances European power.<br />
        There is no extra taxation layer between Europeans and European power.<br />
        European power independently controls how its resources are used.
      </p>

      <h2>Rule 3 — We Oversee</h2>

      <p>Europeans directly oversee the power they choose and fund.</p>

      <p>
        Europeans chosen by lot have full access to observe and report.<br />
        All shared European decisions are made public.<br />
        All European income and spending is fully transparent.
      </p>

      <h2>Test</h2>

      <p>
        Before engaging in any political discussion, ask one question.<br />
        Do they put these three rules first — yes or no?
      </p>

      <p>
        Above parties.<br />
        Above ideologies.<br />
        Above policy goals within a system that cannot act.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Placing anything else first preserves dysfunction and waste —</strong><br />
        <strong>at the direct expense of Europeans.</strong>
