This repository hosts the public website for **The European Manifesto** and its supporting book **The European House**.

- Manifesto: https://europeanmanifesto.eu  
- Book: https://europeanmanifesto.eu/the-european-house/

## About

The European Manifesto sets out three structural rules required for Europe to function as a democratic and effective system:

1. Europeans directly choose European power  
2. Europeans directly fund the power they choose  
3. Europeans directly oversee the power they choose and fund  

The European House is a longer-form book that explains this argument using a single guiding metaphor: Europe as a shared building.

## Repository Purpose
